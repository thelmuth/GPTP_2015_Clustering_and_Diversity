  abstract =	"Many potential target problems for genetic programming
		 are modal in the sense that qualitatively different
		 modes of response are required for inputs from
		 different regions of the problem's domain. This paper
		 presents a new approach to solving modal problems with
		 genetic programming, using a simple and novel parent
		 selection method called lexicase selection. It then
		 shows how the differential performance of genetic
		 programming with and without lexicase selection can be
		 used to provide a measure of problem modality, and it
		 argues that defining such a measure in this way is not
		 as methodologically problematic as it may initially
		 appear. The modality measure is illustrated through the
		 analysis of genetic programming runs on a simple modal
		 symbolic regression problem. This is a preliminary
		 report that is intended in part to stimulate discussion
		 on the significance of modal problems, methods for
		 solving them, and methods for measuring the modality of
		 problems. Although the core concepts in this paper are
		 presented in the context of genetic programming, they
		 are also relevant to applications of other forms of
		 evolutionary computation to modal problems.",

  abstract =	"We describe a broad class of problems, called
		 uncompromising problems, characterised by the
		 requirement that solutions must perform optimally on
		 each of many test cases. Many of the problems that have
		 long motivated genetic programming research, including
		 the automation of many traditional programming tasks,
		 are uncompromising. We describe and analyse the
		 recently proposed lexicase parent selection algorition
		 and show that it can facilitate the solution of
		 uncompromising problems by genetic programming. Unlike
		 most traditional parent selection techniques, lexicase
		 selection does not base selection on a fitness value
		 that is aggregated over all test cases; rather, it
		 considers test cases one at a time in random order. We
		 present results comparing lexicase selection to more
		 traditional parent selection methods, including
		 standard tournament selection and implicit fitness
		 sharing, on four uncompromising problems: finding terms
		 in finite algebras, designing digital multipliers,
		 counting words in files, and performing symbolic
		 regression of the factorial function. We provide
		 evidence that lexicase selection maintains higher
		 levels of population diversity than other selection
		 methods, which may partially explain its utility as a
		 parent selection algorithm in the context of
		 uncompromising problems.",
